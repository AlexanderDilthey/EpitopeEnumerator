If these are the variant alleles

REF: ACGT
A1 : T_CG
A2 : TTCG

.. and the transcript goes from 1 - 3, i.e. covering REF = ACG

... then we will cut down the alternative alleles accordingly:
	A1: T_C
	A2: TTC

Treats VCFs as genome representations
	E.g. when trying to find out which variants are tumour-only, we assume REF/REF if normal VCF doesn't specify anything
	Will miss to mark variants as interesting that are e.g. NONREF/NONREF in normal and REF/REF in tumour unless specified in tumour VCF.
